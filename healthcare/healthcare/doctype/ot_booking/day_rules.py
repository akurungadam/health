"""Rules for a committed list. Adding a case never needs a reason, but on the day of surgery
only an emergency, or an OT Manager, can add one or move one in from another day. Once a case
is published (Scheduled), moving it, rescheduling it, cancelling it or returning it to
Tentative needs a reason; a Tentative case changes freely. The reason is for that one change:
once saved it goes to the timeline and the field is emptied for the next one.

The past is fixed: a case whose start has passed is not moved, only rescheduled (to the To
schedule pane), cancelled or moved on in status, and no case is placed at a time already gone.
A start up to one grid step (15 minutes) ago still counts as now, for a case dropped on the
current time."""
